# My Full-Stack Technical Assessment Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to three progressive technical challenges that showcase my full-stack development expertise.

## What I've Accomplished

I've tackled three key areas of software engineering:

- **Code Refactoring**: Applied SOLID principles to transform legacy code
- **Performance Analysis**: Provided systematic approach to diagnosing bottlenecks
- **System Design**: Architected a scalable real-time notification system

## My Solutions

### [PART1.md](./PART1.md) - Code Refactoring Solution

**What I Did**: Transformed spaghetti code into clean, maintainable architecture

**My Approach**:

- Applied SOLID principles throughout the codebase
- Implemented security best practices (prevented SQL injection)
- Created proper separation of concerns (Repository, Service, Validation layers)
- Added TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Built comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Created functional template with form controls and data binding

**Technologies I Used**: Node.js/Express, Angular, TypeScript

### [PART2.md](./PART2.md) - Performance Analysis Solution

**What I Did**: Developed systematic approach to diagnose slow APIs and frontend issues

**My Strategy**:

- Created performance troubleshooting methodology
- Outlined monitoring and observability strategies
- Identified database optimization techniques
- Analyzed frontend performance bottlenecks
- Recommended specific tools for different scenarios

**My Focus**: APM tools, database profiling, memory analysis, change detection optimization

### [PART3.md](./PART3.md) - System Design Solution

**What I Did**: Designed a comprehensive real-time notification system

**My Design**:

- Created scalable architecture with proper technology selection
- Implemented robust security (authentication, authorization)
- Designed message persistence with delivery guarantees
- Built retry mechanisms and fault tolerance
- Used Mermaid diagrams to visualize the architecture

**Technologies I Selected**: WebSocket (Socket.io), Redis, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

## Skills I've Demonstrated

- **Architecture**: Clean code principles, layered architecture, microservices patterns
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, input validation, SQL injection prevention
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, monitoring, profiling techniques
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, message queuing
- **Real-time Systems**: WebSocket implementation, pub/sub patterns, delivery guarantees
